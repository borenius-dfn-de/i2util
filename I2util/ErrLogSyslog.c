/*
 * Function:	I2ErrLogSyslog()
 *
 * Description:	The I2ErrLogSyslog() function is a client logging function
 *		that may be passed to DPOpenErr() as the `log_func' argument.
 *
 *		Upon invocation, I2ErrLogSyslog() writes a logging message
 *		to the system log via  a call to syslog(). The behavior of 
 *		I2ErrLogSyslog()
 *		may be controlled by the structure pointed to by `arg'. The
 *		members of the structure pointed to by `arg' that may be
 *		set include:
 *
 *
 *			*ident		A string passed as the first parameter
 *					to openlog() the first time 
 *					I2ErrLogSys() is called iff ident 
 *					is not NULL.
 *
 *			logopt		An integer passed as the second
 *					parameter to openlog iff ident
 *					is not NULL.
 *
 *			facility	An integer passed as the third
 *					parameter to openlog iff ident is
 *					not NULL.
 *
 *			priority	An integer log priority passed to 
 *					syslog as its first argument.
 *	
 *			line_info	A bit mask indicating how each output
 *					line should be formatted. The mask
 *					is a bitwise inclusive OR of the
 *					valid attribute bits. If line_info
 *					is zero nothing is printed.
 *
 *		Valid attribute mask bits include:
 *
 *			I2NAME	
 *			I2FILE
 *			I2LINE
 *			I2DATE
 *			I2RTIME
 *			I2MSG
 *
 *		If I2NAME is set `program_name', followed by a ":" is 
 *		copied to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2FILE is set the string "FILE=", followed by 
 *		`file', followed by ",", followed by a space is copied 
 *		to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2LINE is set the string "LINE=", followed by the ascii
 *		representation of `line', followed by ",", followed by 
 *		a space is copied to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2DATE is set the string "DATE=", followed by 
 *		`date', followed by ",", followed by a space is copied 
 *		to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2RTIME is set the string "RTIME=", followed by 
 *		`time', followed by ",", followed by a space is copied 
 *		to `arg->fp', where `time' is string formatted by
 *		arg->tformat.
 *	
 *		If I2MSG is set `msg' is copied to `arg->fp.
 *
 *
 * In Args:
 *
 *	*arg	A pointer to a I2ErrLogSyslogAttr structure.
 *
 * Out Args:
 *
 * Return Values:
 *
 * Side Effects:
